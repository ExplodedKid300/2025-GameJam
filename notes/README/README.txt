Hi there.
This is my submission for the 2025 Game Off November GameGam, the topic being Waves
This project is a rouge-lite *similar to Soul Knight) Your only weapon is a gun, and You have to go from room to room, defeating waves of enemies in order to proceed.
After every room, you get a card. The rarity of the card determines the abount of Buffs and Debuffs the card will have.

The rarities from the most common to the most rare are:
Basic

Uncomon
Rare
Epic
Legendary
Mystic
Cursed
