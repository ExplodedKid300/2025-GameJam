Hi there! ExplodedKid here!

This is my submission for the 2025 Game Off November GameJam, the topic being **Waves**. This is also my very first GameJam as well.
This project is a rouge-lite (similar to Soul Knight) Your only weapon is a gun, and you have to defeat waves of enemies.
After every wave, you get a card. The rarity of the card determines the buffs and debuffs the card will have.
Also, in case you couldn't tell, the gradient of some of the card backgrounds used a gradient with a trianular/saw wave repeat method.

The rarities from the most common to the most rare are:
Basic
Common
Uncomon
Rare
Epic
Legendary
Mystic
Cursed
